# Currency Change Fix - ✅ COMPLETED

## Issues Found & Fixed
- ✅ **Fixed dual currency states**: Removed duplicate currency state in Layout.tsx, now using single source of truth in App.tsx
- ✅ **Fixed state propagation**: Currency changes now properly flow from App.tsx → Layout → Header → Views → Data hooks
- ✅ **Optimized React Query**: Improved query settings for better currency responsiveness

## Implementation Summary
- [x] **App.tsx**: Added proper currency state management with change handler and logging
- [x] **Layout.tsx**: Updated to accept currency as prop, removed local state
- [x] **useCoinData.ts**: Optimized query settings (reduced staleTime, added refetch options)
- [x] **Tested**: Verified currency changes work across all views (All Coins, Highlights)

## Key Changes Made
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Currency state now managed in App.tsx and passed down through props
2. **Better React Query Config**: Reduced staleTime from 60s to 30s, added refetchOnWindowFocus and refetchOnMount
3. **Debug Logging**: Added console logging to track currency changes
4. **Proper State Flow**: Currency changes now trigger data refetch automatically

## Test Results
✅ Currency dropdown works correctly
✅ Data refreshes when switching currencies (USD → EUR → JPY → GBP → INR)
✅ All price displays update properly
✅ Console logs show currency change events
✅ React Query properly invalidates and refetches data with new currency
